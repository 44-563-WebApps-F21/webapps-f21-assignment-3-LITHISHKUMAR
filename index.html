    <h4>Finding a negative cycle in the graph</h4>
    <p>
    <blockquote>
        The Bellman–Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of
        the other vertices in a weighted digraph. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but
        more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers. The
        algorithm was first proposed by Alfonso Shimbel (1955), but is instead named after Richard Bellman and Lester
        Ford Jr., who published it in 1958 and 1956, respectively.[2] Edward F. Moore also published a variation of the
        algorithm in 1959, and for this reason it is also sometimes called the Bellman–Ford–Moore algorithm.
        <br>
        Negative edge weights are found in various applications of graphs, hence the usefulness of this algorithm. If
        a graph contains a "negative cycle" (i.e. a cycle whose edges sum to a negative value) that is reachable from
        the source, then there is no cheapest path: any path that has a point on the negative cycle can be made cheaper
        by one more walk around the negative cycle. In such a case, the Bellman–Ford algorithm can detect and report the
        negative cycle.

    <h5>Using Bellman-Ford algorithm</h5>
    Bellman-Ford algorithm allows you to check whether there exists a cycle of negative weight in the graph, and if it
    does, find one of these cycles.
    <br>
    The details of the algorithm are described in the article on the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Here we'll describe only
    its application to this problem.
    <br>
    Do N iterations of Bellman-Ford algorithm. If there were no changes on the last iteration, there is no cycle of
    negative weight in the graph. Otherwise take a vertex the distance to which has changed, and go from it via its
    ancestors until a cycle is found. This cycle will be the desired cycle of negative weight.
