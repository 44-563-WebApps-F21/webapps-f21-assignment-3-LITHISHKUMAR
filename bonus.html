    <h1>Nabokov Belloc</h1>
    <p>Elaine Belloc is an angel whose biological father is one of the strongest beings in the Universe: Michael
        Demiurgos. Being a daughter of the Archangel means her superpowers know no bounds. Moreover, she's learning her
        trade from the best in both Lucifer and Michael.
        <br>
        Elaine can easily overpower everyone, even if she isn't at her best. In fact, she hasn't yet mastered her
        superpowers. So, it's scary to think that she can still overcome anyone without them.</p>
